**PROBLEM SET 1.2**
-------------------

1. In fd1d_1.1.c, go to the governing equation, Eq. (1.9a) and (1.9b), and
change the factor 0.5 to 1.0. What happens? Change it to 1.1.
Now what happens?
Change it to 0.25 and see what happens.

    > Changing this value does not change transmission speed (as speed is an
    inherent value of the system and represented by ticks) it instead changes
    the transmission value of the space the field is traveling through, the
    conductance.
